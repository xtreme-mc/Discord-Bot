# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not create a public issue.** To prevent the vulnerability from being exploited, contact us privately.
2. Send an email to [yassineouertani877@gmail.com](mailto:yassineouertani877@gmail.com) with the following details:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - (Optional) Potential fix or patch suggestion.

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and aim to provide a resolution or patch within **7 days**.

## General Security Guidelines

To ensure the security of your bot and server, follow these best practices:
- Use environment variables to store sensitive information like tokens.
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Regularly update dependencies using `pip install --upgrade`.
- Restrict bot permissions to the minimum required for its functionality.
- Monitor logs for unusual behavior and disable the bot if necessary.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability is reported and patched, we will:
1. Notify users via a release note.
2. Attribute the reporter (if they agree to be credited).
3. Publish the details of the fix after ensuring affected users have time to update.

Thank you for helping us maintain the security of our project!
